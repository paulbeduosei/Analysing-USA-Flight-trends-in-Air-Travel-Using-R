Just wrapped up an aviation data analysis project exploring flight duration trends across NYC airports using the nycflights2022 dataset ✈️📊

As the “head data analyst” for this project, I dove into thousands of flights departing from JFK, LGA, and EWR during the second half of 2022 to uncover how flight times vary by airline, time of year, and departure airport.

The goal? To understand operational patterns that can help aviation teams optimize flight durations, improve scheduling, and ultimately create a smoother experience for passengers.

This project blended data wrangling, visualization, and statistical insight — and it reminded me how fascinating real-world datasets can be. Aviation is full of hidden patterns… you just need the right tools to reveal them 👀📉
I had a blast building this analysis, and it’s now part of my growing portfolio of “fun but meaningful” data projects.
